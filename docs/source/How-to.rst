TomoSAXS: Multimodal X-ray analysis of collagenous tissues combining micro-CT and volumetric SAXS
=======================

.. _Overview:

Overview
------------
TomoSAXS is a framework for combining micro-CT and tomographic SAXS (small angled X-ray scattering) data, 
to spatially analyse nanoscale structural and strain/pre-strain in soft collagen organs using SAXS, and 
compare with micro-scale structure and strain/pre-strain estimated from micro-CT. All data is originally 
obtained at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron (` <https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home.html>`_), and the pipeline is currently 
formatted for the data structure applied by DLS.
