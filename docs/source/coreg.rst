CT to SAXS volume coregistration
==================================

.. _Overview:

Overview
------------
Describes the steps in aligning the CT 3D image to the SAXS maps, including fixing coordinate system, downsampling of CT to SAXS voxel size, parameters from CT per SAXS voxel.

.. _ctdata:

----------------

1. Example IVD CT image (phase contrast CT)
2. Example IVD fibre traced image

.. _coordinates:
Coordinate systems
-------------------
Coordinate systems for CT and SAXS. related Figures

.. _downsampling:
Downsampling 
------------------
1. Method of downsampling, code example
2. Regular grid or cluster; where this is selected for in code

.. _parameters:
