Initialisation
---------------
The fibre/voxel index is :math:`i` and the scan index is :math:`k`. Since the amplitudes of the fibres in each voxel :math:`a_{i}` is not known, the following estimation procedure is used. Approximate the fibres as having the mean fibril-parameter values of :math:`q_{i,0},w_{i,a},w_{i,\mu}` (which will be estimated from :math:`I^{k}(q)` for all scan points k). 

Calculate :math:`I^{k}(\chi)` for all scan points k and all rotation angles :math:`r`. Define the observable scattering from each voxel as :math:`V_{i}(q,\chi;{\bf{f}};(\alpha,\beta);r)` where :math:`\bf{f}` is a shorthand for "fibril characteristics" :math:`q_{i,0},w_{i,a},w_{i,\mu}`.
